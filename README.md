# Reinforcement Learning: Inverted Pendulum
For this project, weâ€™ll try to tackle the well-known inverted pendulum problem using the DDPG algorithm. The goal of the algorithm is to produce a policy that given any state of the pendulum returns a suitable torque to be applied to the pendulum in order to get it balanced upside down.
